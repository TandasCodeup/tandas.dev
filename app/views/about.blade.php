                		<p>If you are a disciplined person, you will be able to hold yourself accountable and actually be able to save money.  Otherwise, tandas are a great alternative.

							What is a tanda?  A tanda uses a set amount of people, pooling a set amount of money per set amount of time, to give a lump sum of money to each individual at his/her assigned time.  Wow, that was pretty confusing right?!?

							Let me break it down through an example so that it will be much easier to follow:
							There are 10 people who decide to create a “tanda” together.  They each will give $100 a week.  Each person will be assigned a number and in that order will receive the lump sum of the $1000 (10 people x $100 each).  Whoever is first receives $900 the first week.  (That person receives $900 from the other 9 individuals; add the $100 of their own money and that equals the $1000 lump sum total.)  Whoever is second recevies $900 the second week. And so on.

							So instead of trying to be disciplined enough to save $1000 on your own, using the tanda you will receive that money on your assigned date and you are responsible for paying the others in your tanda each week.  This is a wonderful form of accountability if you’re not disciplined enough to hold yourself accountable.  One person typically is the organizer and as such gathers the money and distributes it to whomever’s turn it is to receive the lump sum.

							To complicate things further, you are allowed to take more than one number.  So let’s say there are only 9 people in the tanda but one person wants to have two numbers.  That means the tanda would act as if there were 10 members but the indvidual who has 2 numbers would be paying double each specified date.

							As in the example above:
							If 9 people decided to pay $100 a week, but one of those individuals decided to take two numbers, he/she would pay $200 each week and would be paid out twice over the course of the tanda.

							This is a very common practice in Mexico (and in the US among Mexican immigrants).  I have never participated in a tanda myself but I think it’s a wonderful concept to hold oneself accountable and actually “save” the money.
